# C++ Result
This is an implementation in C++ of Rust's Result. This is a WIP so not all methods found on Rust's Result type will be here at first. If you would like to help and implement the methods found in Rust's Result, that would be appreciated.

The ability to check for equality between a `Result` and a value was added. However, one problem
arose when this feature was added. If the template types are the same
(for example `Result<int, int>` or `Result<std::string, std::string>`) then a compiler
error will be displayed if equality checking is used. This bug will have to be fixed in the near future. If anyone has an idea how to remedy this problem it will be greatly appreciated.

### List of methods to implement
* `iter()`


## Quick Start
This library contains a header and a source file. Just include the header and add the source file to your list of files to build. Result for C++ uses some C++ 17 library features so you will need a compiler that supports C++ 17.

Compile with `clang++ -o program main.cpp other_file.cpp -std=c++17`

In other_file.cpp:

```cpp
#include "result.hpp"

...
```

## Documentation
Currently, no documentation exist at the moment. The best source of documentation is at the [Rust STD Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) website.
