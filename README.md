### C++ Result
This is an implementation in C++ of Rust's Result. This is a WIP so not all methods found on Rust's Result type will be here at first. If you would like to help and implement the features found in Rust's Result, that would be appreciated.

## Quick Start
This library contains a header and a source file. Just include the header and add the source file to your list of files to build.

### Example

Compile with `clang++ -o program main.cpp other_file.cpp`

In other_file.cpp:

```cpp
#include "result.hpp"

...
```
